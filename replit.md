# Discord Bot Replit Workspace

## Overview

This is a Discord bot built with Python using the discord.py library. The bot provides verification and ticket system functionality for Discord servers. It's designed to run on Replit with Python 3.11 and includes configuration-driven features for role-based verification and support ticket management.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Framework**: discord.py (>=2.5.2)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Command/Event-driven with Cog system
- **Configuration**: JSON-based configuration management
- **Logging**: Built-in Python logging with file and console output

### Project Structure

## Key Components

### 1. Bot Core (main.py)
- **Purpose**: Main bot initialization and configuration loading
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic config.json creation with defaults
  - Comprehensive logging setup
  - Discord intents configuration for message content, reactions, guilds, and members
  - Bot class inheritance with custom command prefix ('!')

### 2. Verification System (cogs/verification.py)
- **Purpose**: Handles user verification through emoji reactions
- **Architecture**: Event-driven reaction listener
- **Key Features**:
  - Reaction-based verification system
  - Configurable verification emoji (default: ✅)
  - Role assignment upon verification
  - Embed-based verification messages

### 3. Ticket System (cogs/tickets.py)
- **Purpose**: Support ticket creation and management
- **Architecture**: Discord UI Views with persistent buttons
- **Key Features**:
  - Button-based ticket creation
  - Automatic channel creation with proper permissions
  - Duplicate ticket prevention
  - Category-based organization
  - Custom naming convention: `ticket-{username}-{discriminator}`

### 4. Utility Functions (utils/helpers.py)
- **Purpose**: Shared utility functions across the bot
- **Key Functions**:
  - Configuration loading and saving
  - Staff role validation
  - Ticket management permissions
  - Error handling for JSON operations

### 5. Configuration Management
- **File**: config.json
- **Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "verification_role_id": 1020374565190389767,
    "ticket_category_id": null,
    "staff_role_ids": [],
    "verification_emoji": "✅"
  }
  ```

## Data Flow

### Verification Flow
1. User reacts to verification message with configured emoji
2. Bot detects reaction via `on_raw_reaction_add` event
3. Bot validates message source and embed content
4. Bot assigns verification role to user
5. Action logged for audit purposes

### Ticket Creation Flow
1. User clicks "Create Ticket" button
2. Bot checks for existing tickets by username
3. Bot creates new channel with proper permissions
4. Bot sets up ticket-specific overwrites
5. Bot places channel in configured category (if set)

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **discord.py** (>=2.5.2): Core Discord API wrapper
- **aiohttp**: HTTP client for Discord API (dependency of discord.py)
- **Standard library**: json, logging, asyncio, os

### Discord Requirements
- **Bot Token**: Required environment variable or manual input
- **Bot Permissions**: 
  - Send Messages
  - Manage Channels
  - Manage Roles
  - Add Reactions
  - Read Message History
  - View Channels

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Configuration
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11 with Nix package manager
- **Execution**: Automatic pip install of discord.py followed by main.py execution
- **Workflow**: Parallel execution setup with dedicated "Discord Bot" workflow

### Environment Setup
1. Bot automatically installs discord.py on startup
2. Configuration file created with defaults if missing
3. Logging initialized with both file and console output
4. Bot token required for authentication (not included in repository)

### Scalability Considerations
- Modular cog system allows easy feature expansion
- JSON configuration supports runtime modifications
- Logging system provides operational visibility
- Permission-based access control supports multi-server deployment
